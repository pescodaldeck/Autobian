# How to use  

This repository contains three possible procedures to set up your Debian ISO for autoinstalling.  

You can choose between:

**Using Autobian script** _(Not recommended)_

> * You're all set! Time to boot into your machine

> notably increases hardware/software compatibility. In case you don't feel like going with the prebuilt ISO, you
> can always follow both [**Manual setup**](http://github.com/pescodaldeck/Autobian/
